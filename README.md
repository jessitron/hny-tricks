# Hny Tricks

in which jess makes a GUI for the things she wants to accomplish in the honeycomb API

## run locally

`npm run start`

## weird dependencies

This uses my own version of htmx, instrumented in my own way. Find it in ~/code/bigskysoftware/htmx (or forked at jessitron/htmx)

It also uses my own hny.js to initialize otel. Where did I get that??
